Just as some countries do not give in to the idea of creating a centralized ledger whereby illicit transaction occurs as a result of the technology. Some would argue the fact that digital is beneficial to their countries economy and contributes to their financial stability.

Digital asset poses no threat to the stability of a countries finance. Instead, it has been said to be a positive impact on an economy, serving as a hedge against bad government policies, and useful economic functions.

What are Digital Assets

A digital asset is a media or text that is formatted into a binary source and includes right-to-use features. The right-to-use feature is what makes the digital file a digital asset. So when a digital file doesn’t come with a right to use, it’s not a digital asset. A digital asset is majorly categorized into media assets and textual content.

A digital asset is increasingly becoming more important in the world of asset management. It’s no news that corporations like Microsoft and Apple are providing management features of a digital asset. These assets keep on existing notwithstanding where or when it was created, even as technology continues to progress.

A digital asset can be owned by individuals and can be used as a currency for transaction purposes and storing intangible contents, like videos or documents. Examples of digital assets are Cryptocurrencies such as non-fungible tokens(NFTs) which is a certificate of ownership for original digital content, bitcoins, and the likes.

Digital assets are securely held in a decentralized database or a centralized ledger called the blockchain. This decentralized database allows for the transfer of digital assets without the need for bank, broker, third party involvement, hence scraping the intermediaries to transactions.

Digital asset has significantly grown in importance over the years, but there is an argument as to their effect on the financial stability of a country and causing economic issues. The majority of individuals believe investment in digital assets and adopting payment methods is an innovation that shifts the financial sector of an economy and facilitates the smooth transaction between businesses and individuals.

So what are the effects digital assets have on the financial stability of countries economies;

Digital assets possess importance to the improvement of a nation's economy, increasing the financial stability of the country through reducing the cost of transfers, making transactions faster, creating new market opportunities between countries, offering high security for financial transactions.

With the rapid advancement in technology across the financial sector, digital assets have majorly hacked the benefits of this innovation, entering into the mainstream of finance, thereby contributing to the stability of countries economies.

Low transfer fees, high security, rapid transactions, and new market opportunities are among the main benefits of using digital assets for businesses. Bitcoin brought about some major positive growth in the digital asset ecosystem since its creation in 2009 and has enabled a wide range of tokens.

Although digital assets aren't regulated as a result of their decentralized database, it still maintains as a highly secure method of payment. Using digital assets as a means of payment is generally becoming a major method among individuals. There are many benefits digital asset offers to business and countries.

Low-Cost Transactions

Most businesses and countries undergo transactions in their hundreds and thousands weekly and some daily. A digital asset can aid countries in minimizing transactions costs during intra country trade and international trade. Saving the government lot of costs incurred during transactions. It is paramount to know that cost of transactions can be as low as possible when using a digital asset for transactions. Amount saved while using a digital asset for a transaction depends on a variety of factors that occurs, some of which are processing fee, which must be checked regularly.

Processing fees are costs incurred when you send and receive digital assets through third-party platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and others. It's part of their terms of the agreement, one has no option but to accept the processing cost. So it's important to check the processing fee, so you can select a party that suits your needs. When Countries involve themselves in international trade with another country using a digital asset as a means of payment, it helps the economy by reducing unnecessary fees that are incurred when the traditional method is being used.

Highly Secured

A major effect the use of digital assets has on the financial stability of a country is its feature of security. Instead of paying a high fee to perform a secured transaction. The transparent public ledger the digital asset is recorded in makes it possible for easy tracking of transactions and to perform audit trails.

Transaction performed using digital asset are irreversible once it has been done, and it can not be tampered with or hacked. This saves countries from the high occurrence of stolen funds. These assets are majorly controlled by the owner and are securely protected by the technology called Blockchain, shielding your asset from stealings and hackers.

Rapid Transaction Process

Delay in the transaction process can be quite devastating, especially when it is inter-country transactions. Sometimes most governments incur more costs just to put forth their trade. Digital asset transactions are very fast and still offer you control over the process. You can get any transaction approved and choose what transaction to initiate. This helps to reduce waiting time during transactions between businesses and countries.

New Market Opportunities

When a digital asset is introduced into a country or business, it enables the establishment of a new market. Using digital assets helps get in business with individuals who are also owners of digital assets, thereby widening the market opportunities. This gives a competitive advantage over other countries and businesses. And increases the financial capacity of the country.

Before venturing into the use of digital assets for transactions, it's important to take into consideration the volatility of a digital asset. This means that the price of the digital asset can rise and fall. That aside, the effect of digital assets on the financial stability of most countries is advantageous. It gives a competitive advantage to countries and increases their financial capacity."
1,"It’s no longer a secret that cryptocurrency is one of the most lucrative industries out there. But it’s also quite apparent that the market is rife with hacks and scams.

A large number of users have lost access to their wallets, made poor investments in low-quality ICO projects, or fell prey to cybercriminals. So, why invest in crypto in the first place?

Why Crypto?

While there may have been some ambiguity about the benefits of cryptocurrency a few years back, there is no longer any doubt: cryptocurrency is here to stay and it's going to completely disrupt all existing models. We are seeing this happening right now and the benefits are undeniable.

Blockchain transactions are immutable and corruption-free, not to mention lightning-fast and very cost-effective. There are a number of blockchains to choose from that can be tweaked to specific industries. It’s not really a matter of whether the industry as a whole is going to thrive. It’s just a matter of finding good cryptocurrencies within the industry and holding onto them.

With all this in mind, the following tips will outline the most important things to be made aware of in order to safely invest in crypto.

Tip #1 - Secure Your Private Keys

The number 1 tip when investing in cryptocurrency is to make a copy of your private key. Every cryptocurrency wallet will have an associated private key. If you lose this private key, you lose your wallet. It’s that simple.

The good news is all you have to do is make two or three copies of this private key and store it in a secure location. Once you do this, your keys are safe, and so are your wallet funds. Some people overthink this part, saying that leaving copies of your private keys is a security vulnerability.

But the chances of a thief somehow locating a piece of paper with a passcode or random words written on it, copying it down, and then restoring it before you do are tiny in comparison to the chances of just losing your keys.

Tip #2 - Use a Secure Crypto Wallet

Exchanges have a history of being hacked. Though this is no longer as dangerous as it once was, it’s still far better to use a privacy and security focused crypto wallet. The main options include hardware wallets, desktop wallets, or secure online wallets.

All of these will offer you a private key for safe storage. This is not the case with exchanges where you will have an account open and the centralized party holds onto these keys. This is now a smart option.

Even ‘DeFi’ applications are subject to scams and hacks if you keep your funds stored with them. BadgerDAO recently suffered an attack that drained over $120 Million worth of cryptocurrencies.

The takeaway, as always, is that users need to hold onto their private keys. The more you let other people take ownership of your funds, the more likely you are to lose them. This has happened time and time again and cryptocurrency was initially designed to grant wallet ownership and responsibility to citizens.

Tip #3 - Diversify Your Investments

For the purpose of investing and generating a good ROI, then new users will need to pay heed to the age old principle of diversification. Nobody can predict the future. So unless you have access to a certain event, then you won’t be able to predict market growth.

If you invest too heavily in a small number of projects, then you might not see a significant return. A large number of ICO projects went completely bust in 2019. The same could easily apply to the NFT startup space with its SHO and IDO offerings.

Correct diversification could assist in this area to ensure you are not spreading yourself too thin. Even if you take a few hits, your diversification will ensure you thrive into the future. Minimizing risk is still as important as maximizing gains, a point often forgotten amidst a large amount of crypto-related hype.

Tip #4 - Hold Your Crypto

If you had bought and held onto any of the major cryptocurrencies in the past 5 years - Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Dash - you would have made enormous profits. The same is likely to be true for a number of cryptocurrencies moving forward in the next 5 years. If you can hold onto them, you will make large profits. The industry is growing as a whole with massive institutional investment.

This also makes sense due to the fact that you lose money every time you make a trade. Gas fees on the Ethereum network are huge, and this is the blockchain that most of the latest projects are on, for the foreseeable future. Frequently moving your assets also makes the tracking and monitoring of them quite problematic.

So just keep it simple, identify a number of solid cryptocurrencies, and hold onto them for reasonable time frames. Investment is not the same as trading, and it's critical to ignore the noise and only focus on the signal.

Tip #5 - Get the Right Tools

There is a distinct lack of analytical tools on the market when it comes to cryptocurrency trading and investment. But there are some tools that you can use to pinpoint investments a little more accurately.

One such tool is Defy Trends, which combines both social sentiment and fundamental indicators to analyze investments. Social sentiment features hugely in the crypto asset market as most coins trade on launches and Tweets as opposed to more traditional trading variables. The tool lets you compare cryptocurrencies and see whether a given coin is over or undervalued.

Of course, there are many ways to invest in cryptocurrencies and you will likely have your own preferences. The platforms you use will depend on these preferences and what you are looking to achieve. You might prefer to invest in NFTs, sustainable cryptocurrencies, or coins in a given sector. But the more accurate information you have, from the right sources, the better.

Tip #6 - Be Selective

This is related to the advice to hold onto your crypto and don’t be in any rush to invest. The blockchain space moves incredibly rapidly and it’s easy to get sold on lucrative sounding coins. Many of these coins are nothing but a whitepaper and a theory.

There are multiple token offerings being advertised as inclusive virtual reality metaverses where you can buy and sell NFTs. The issue is that the ‘Metaverse’ the project is talking about has not yet even been created!

So take your time and make your moves wisely. The cryptocurrency industry is not going anywhere and if you carefully consider your coins and hold them for reasonable time periods (12 months +) you’re sure to make a profit.

Tip #7 - Understand the Ecosystem

For crypto investing, it’s good to stay abreast with current developments. New users will obviously need to get familiar with blockchain wallets and private keys, as well as the best places to purchase and trade cryptocurrency. With this knowledge, more intelligent decisions can be made because transaction fees will be more readily understood. You will also be less likely to fall for hacks and scams when you’re more familiar with the wider ecosystem.

Investing in some of the newer technologies will require becoming more familiar with certain software. The Metamask Web 3.0 application on the Brave browser is frequently needed for the trading of certain tokens, especially NFTs.

Research on Decentralized Exchanges. Strong Holder Offerings, and new types of distributed ledgers are also necessary in order to make better decisions. You don’t need to know everything about a specific coin to invest, but you do need to get a strong sense of where it’s going and what architecture it's built on.

Tip #8 - Know The Risks

Even when a company seems 100% legitimate, something can go wrong in an instant. Exchanges that seem extremely security conscious can easily get hacked from any number of network vulnerabilities. Pump and dump schemes are common within the ICO space. The US Securities and Exchanges Commission is routinely investigating many new startups, forcing them to shut down for non-compliance.

If your coins get lost due to a scam, there is pretty much nothing you can do. You have no legal recourse. But if you make a significant profit from your coins, you probably do have a large reporting obligation to the IRS. Even purchases made using Bitcoin and other cryptos are treated as realized profits/losses to be accounted for.

In other words, while you can likely make a significant profit in this industry, it’s not without its fair share of risks to account for. Only by educating yourself on the industry and taking the correct security precautions can you ensure that your funds are safe.

Conclusion

Distributed Ledger Technology is an expanding network that is rendering obsolete all older models. In the rise of any new system, there are always a lot of initial failures but the progress of the wider ecosystem is inevitable.

That’s why it's imperative to simply choose a diverse number of coins and consistently invest in them. Once securely stored in a high-quality crypto wallet, your holdings are likely to increase significantly in value, with time."
2,"Bitcoin is widely known as a digital currency that possesses value. It has been used as a medium of exchange, fulfilling transactions between peers without involving any financial institution or government. A unique feature of the bitcoin system is the fact that it uses a digital technology called blockchain that ensures the security of the user’s bitcoin. The main idea behind Satoshi Nakamoto creating the bitcoin in 2009, was to abrogate the need for middlemen like banks in completing transactions.

The cryptocurrencies market in most cases is unpredictable. Just as bitcoin was without worth years ago, when the first transaction a bitcoin was used, was to purchase a pizza for 10,000 bitcoins. Now a bitcoin value weighs more in value over cash currency. And its system prevents duplication of coins through fraudulent means.

What’s Needed to Invest in Bitcoin

There are certain important things you must have before venturing into investing in bitcoin. Although the must-haves aren’t much but are vital to begin an investment. And they are;

Secured internet connection

Documents containing personal information

Bank account information

Some of these essentials are only needed when you will be investing by yourself. But when purchasing through a stockbroker, you need not supply either your bank or personal information.

How to Invest in Bitcoin

The assumed sophistication of bitcoin must have driven most people to believe that investing in such is complex. But it’s the complete opposite, as investing in bitcoin is as simple as it can be. To affirm that, here are steps on how to invest in Bitcoin.

Joining a bitcoin exchange

The first step to put into action is to know which bitcoin exchange you would prefer in performing a bitcoin-related transaction. Bitcoin doesn’t have an organization, because it’s a technology that’s open-sourced, yet various platforms help facilitate Bitcoin transactions. The exchange platform popular among the investor is the cryptocurrency exchanges. These exchange platforms act as middlemen in the cryptocurrency investment market, just like the duty of a stock brokerage.

When you’ve decided on purchasing an exchange platform, then you will have to make another important decision about the platform you want to purchase bitcoin from. Here are some of the popular exchanges;

Kraken: This is an exchange that is based in San Francisco, and allows for investment of bitcoin using currencies of various countries.

Binance: this is among the largest exchange, and focuses majorly on altcoin.

Bitfinex: it’s an exchange that’s majorly optimized for more experience lenders and traders. Currently, Bitfinex doesn’t deal with US traders.

Coinbase: there are popular for their insuring features, where they insure losses that were caused by fraudulent transfers or when there is a security breach.

Choosing the perfect exchange for your purchase of bitcoin is a great step to begin the investment of bitcoin. Although most investors have difficulty choosing the perfect exchange, once you figure what you expect from an exchange, it helps narrow it down.

Have a Bitcoin Wallet

To make purchases of bitcoin, you would need to have a wallet, where purchased coins get stored in. To buy a coin into your wallet, you would need to decide on which exchange you wish to make use of, then follow these easy steps to buy into the wallet:

Sign up to a wallet app or an exchange platform

Go to the setting bar of the platform/app

click on the transfer button

Then select the bitcoin currency and enter the amount you is to buy

Next, click on the continue button and select your payment method

follow through to complete the transaction

When a purchase has been made for bitcoin, it gets stored in your wallet, where all cryptocurrencies are stored. There are two types of wallets you can have, the hot wallet and the cold wallet.

A cold wallet is known as the wallet method with the safest storage for coins. The cold wallets are similar to a flash drive, hardware where your coins are stored in a portable device. When trading a large number of coins, a cold wallet is the best fit that would be worth your investment, because of its storage features. Its prices are quite on the high side, costing about $60-$100for wallet.

The hot wallet is a wallet that is operated by a certain provider or an exchange. Most times, these hot wallets are given automatically by some exchange when an account is being opened. Its deemed convenient as you can gain access to your coin through the internet. Although a hot wallet isn’t considered the safest method of storage of coins, because if an exchange is hacked, you are liable to lose your coins and information regarding it. But some of these exchanges offer to insure the investor coins against such events.

Connect the Wallet with your Bank Account

After getting a bitcoin wallet, then you would need to connect your bank account, debit, or credit card with your wallet to purchase your bitcoin. For a new investor, it takes up to four days to make a transaction when a bank account is used. But when the bank account has been linked with the wallet, one can easily carry out transactions, buying and selling bitcoin.

The use of a debit card or credit allows for a very swift process of buying bitcoin. Although it helps in purchasing, it doesn’t facilitate the selling of bitcoin.

Link a Bitcoin Exchange

The bitcoin exchange is a platform that facilitates the trading of bitcoin, exchanging the coin with traditional currencies. When a bitcoin exchange user purchases bitcoin online, two options are always offered to them. Bitcoin exchanges all have different features that make them unique and also offer different services, no bitcoin exchange is the same. Their feature varies in reputation of the exchange, security, availability of cryptocurrency, its processing fee. So to find a perfect market, you must perform adequate research on numerous exchanges before finally choosing the right that suits your needs.

Placing an order

When all the steps above have been completed, you can now begin buying and selling bitcoins. And while making a transaction, you must put in mind that the prices of bitcoin can increase and reduce, which means you must be analytical in your buying and selling, to avoid huge losses.

Listed above are the steps for a beginner who is just about entering the market of cryptocurrency and looking to invest in bitcoin. Following each of these steps ease your investment process and helps reduce the risk of making a setup mistake. To be successful in the investment of bitcoin, you must understand some of its technicality and ensure you know how the market works."
3,"The crypto world has seen tremendous growth, especially within the past few years. Ever since the inception of Bitcoin’s blockchain, we have seen literally thousands of altcoins and projects that have tried to get to the top and climb the crypto ladder.

Some of these projects have made the cut, while others have failed and will always just be a part of crypto's history. That said, today, we will be taking a look at the top 3 crypto projects that are worth your attention throughout 2022 and potentially even beyond.

We'll be going over Solana, Algorand, and Cardano, and hopefully, by the end of this, you'll see what makes them so special.

Solana (SOL)

Solana is essentially this web-scale blockchain that aims to provide quick, secure, and scalable decentralized applications alongside marketplaces.

This can be evident through the Solana ecosystem, which is already filled with over 500 DeFi and Web 3 applications, ranging from applications to games, and even non-fungible tokens (NFTs); if something is viral within the crypto world, the chances are high that it will eventually get built on Solana.

Solana is a platform that was founded in 2017 by Anatoly Yakovenko, who worked at Qualcomm before he managed to launch Solana.

The main way Solana stood out and attracted the attention of many developers is through its Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus, which is an algorithm specifically created to allow a higher level of efficiency and throughput rate. This means that having historical records of events of transactions allows the system to easily track them and keep track of orders as a whole.

Then there’s Tower BFT, which is a PoH-optimized version of PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Toleration), which takes advantage of the synchronized clock and prevents overhead and transaction latency.

The SOL token is the native cryptocurrency token that you’ll use on Solana, and it can be staked, where stakers can earn additional rewards. It can also be used to perform micropayments, known as lamports on Solana.

In any case, Solana is one of the largest crypto projects at the moment and is worth paying attention to for years to come, as it has the potential to climb high both in value as well as utility.

Algorand (ALGO)

Algorand was launched in 2019 and is a self-sustaining, decentralized, blockchain-based network specifically developed to support a wide range of applications. It is known due to the fact that it takes advantage of what is known as Pure-Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) as its consensus algorithm. Here, it distributes the ALGO cryptocurrency in the economy with each new block to everyone with a specific number of ALGO tokens within their wallets.

The ALGO token is the native cryptocurrency tokens that power the Algorand Ecosystem, where it can be used as a means of paying for the transactions alongside the smart contract computations on the network.

Algorand can even be used in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications which are built outside of its ecosystem through synthetic versions of its token. You'll probably see Wrapped ALGO, which is an ERC-20 token, for example, working with the Ethereum blockchain, just to name an example.

This is a project created by Silvio Micali, a computer scientist, and a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor. Micali authored the Algorand white paper alongside Jing Chen in 2017, who is a Stony Brook University Professor.

Algorand is a protocol that's split across two layers, where Layer-1 is used to run the smart contracts, handle the atomic swaps alongside the rapid peer-to-peer exchanges of cryptocurrency tokens. The creation of new, Algorand-based assets happens at this layer.

Layer-2 is intended to run a larger, feature-filled smart contract network.

To participate in voting, users can stake ALGO to generate a valid participation key that allows them to become a Participation Node, where each node can coordinate through a Relay Node, which facilitates communication.

This is definitely yet another project that is re-shaping the blockchain's functionality and has introduced changes and innovations, which has helped put it on the map as one of the best crypto projects worth your attention throughout 2022 and beyond.

Cardano (ADA)

Cardano is a decentralized, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain platform founded in 2017 by Charles Hoskinson, who is also the co-founder of Ethereum. It is regarded within the crypto community as one of the largest blockchain networks to successfully implement the PoS consensus mechanism, which proved to be far more energy-efficient than the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus found in other blockchain networks prior to it, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and even Ethereum (ETH) at the point of its launch.

Cardano also supports smart contracts and takes advantage of its native cryptocurrency token known as ADA to allow its users to participate in the network's operation.

The Cardano blockchain network is split across two layers. The first layer is the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL) which facilitates and records all of the ADA transactions, while the second is the Cardano Computation Layer (CCL) which contains the smart contract logic, responsible for determining the rules as well as the conditions for each transaction.

Cardano uses Ouroboros, a specifically created PoS algorithm that creates blocks and validates transactions within the blockchain. This is a network divided into epochs and slots, where epochs represent the overarching timeframes and slots represent 20-second intervals. Throughout each slot, a leader is picked at random with the mission of adding a new block onto the blockchain.

There are three types of nodes that participate in the operation of the Cardano network, and these are Edge nodes, which are used to create cryptocurrency transactions, mCore nodes, which allow users to stake ADA and participate in the distributed governance; and Relay nodes which facilitate data transfers between mCore nodes and the public internet.

These crypto projects have truly introduced something unique and have managed to take the crypto world by storm through their various use cases and ecosystems. They are definitely worth just about anyone's attention, and it’s exciting to see what the future holds for Solana, Algorand, and Cardano."
4,"The Cryptocurrency Metaverse has gained worldwide attention, especially in the past few weeks. This is as a result of the name change of Facebook into Meta. The Metaverse company seeks to influence its social network, combining the firm's VR technology known as Virtual Reality from Oculus Rift as its system for the future.

The metaverse era will allow for a co-existence between cryptocurrencies and modern currency. Thus giving people options in currencies to use in the virtual world. The statement made by Mark Zuckerberg as regards viewing his company as a Metaverse gave a reflection of the company's goals. The Facebook rebranding gave a lot of attention to the metaverse from the public, keeping it on the trend table.

What is the Metaverse?

Metaverse is known as a construct of the virtual world, it's named a shared virtual platform that allows users of the platform to communicate with things that look almost like the real world. Examples of such are, playing video games, watching movies, and even daily conversation with other individuals. It is also known as a concept whereby the digital world connects with the real world.

The Virtual world works with a combination of Virtual Reality Technology and Augmented Reality. This movement of establishing a Virtual world has gained much attention from numerous businesses such as Facebook and projects in the cryptocurrencies world.

The Metaverse is known to have been derived from science-related fiction from a 1992 novel by Neal Stephenson titled ""Snow Crash"".

How is the Metaverse Useful

The internet world is continuously innovating and its access is improving. The Metaverse is providing a platform that enables users to connect via the virtual world and interact with one another more suitably and practically.

The Covid 19 pandemic made this innovation see the light among users. When the world is put on hold, restriction of movement and not being able to do some certain activities. Interaction between individuals became hard and thereby enabled another pandemic of depression.

The initiation of virtual meetings and online chats increasing in the number of users made more people connect using the virtual world than ever before.

The Metaverse aims in possessing a robust connection with the economy of the real world, and also be an extension of the physical world. In other words, the metaverse must be able to trade and invest in goods and services. Perform transactions as the world.

The Metaverse Cryptocurrency

As stated earlier, Metaverse is a virtual world where users connect through a virtual reality headset or their computer system, enabling users to do various kinds of activities. But to effectively be the true reflection of the real world, which includes the economy also, it needs to possess a currency just like the real world. This is where cryptocurrency plays a major role.

The Metaverse Cryptocurrencies are currencies of the virtual world, that are only spent in the metaverse it originates. It's purchased through the virtual reality game. These coins can be used in buying items in the game and trading them with other players of the game.

And just as other cryptocurrencies in the market, that fluctuates, it possesses those features.

The Metaverse cryptocurrency is an open-sourced blockchain project that's public, which aims to give a foundational infrastructure for both enterprise and social wants. It aims to create a digital universe where its digital assets, examples of which are Metaverse Smart Token and Identifiable Token, and digital identities like the Avatar that support transactions of assets with the aid of Oracle known as Value intermediary.

Metaverse is among the first Blockchain in China which has operated successfully for the past four years. The mission is to drive the adoption of blockchain technology through the building of friendly developer tools with easy to use interfaces, this enables users that aren't technical to make use of the technology, both in business and daily lives.

The Metaverse coin can be purchased on major platforms, including the best platform for transacting coins which is the coin wallet. To buy, store and sell, you can Click here.

Metaverse Tool Kit

The metaverse tool kit since creation has been developed for third-party developers to build a decentralized application. The metaverse further promoted the use of their technologies in the year 2020, enabling a wider developer community to begin building metaverse on the substrate.

The Metaverse on Substrate gives all the distinctive features and technologies that make Metaverse a distinctive platform and also new modules. Giving the firm to widen its community.

Here are some of its features; Entropy: Our Native Token, Smart Assets Digital Identity, Smart Contracts

Why Metaverse

Metaverse is an Open-sourced decentralized interoperable platform for the programmable digital asset and digital identities built on the substrate. It's an advanced architecture for secure and easy to build digital identities.

It has the following distinctive features:

Interoperable

It enables any individual to build a smart contract and deploy them to the Metaverse chain. Tools such as Remix, Truffle, and Metamask are used. The Smart contract built will be synonymous through the support provided for stability and also for anything that's EVM bytecode compiled.

Security

Voting and the validating committee don't exit through the Proof of stake, because the whole network validates each block. Therefore the system can shield 51% of attacks and also distributes mining rewards to its investors and stakeholders.

Scalability

Metaverse aims for higher scalability, long term expansion through the utilization of the Substrate modular framework. It also supports connecting decentralized applications, services and enables other stand-alone blockchains to connect and exchange information and also transact at a lower cost.

Top Metaverse Coin

Here are a few metaverse coins:

Decentraland

This coin was among the incumbent metaverse-based projects in crypto. It uses the ethereum virtual world and is also a user-owned build. It enables a platform for exploration, interaction with games and activities. You can purchase land and other items, and also create your environment and application.

The system is governed through the decentralized DAO by its users. It's also associated with tokens like $LAND and $MANA

Enjin

This system provides ways to create a digital asset known as ERC-1155 tokens. Which is to be used across numerous games. It is not restricted to one platform, it gives ownership rights over several platforms. It can also be traded with other users."
5,"Cryptocurrency comes with a plethora of advantages, one of them being increased control and autonomy over your own finances.

But with this advantage comes a major drawback: security. Above all else, those new to the world of crypto will need to familiarise themselves with storing their funds in a safe wallet.

This article is going to explain the different cryptocurrency wallet types so you can choose the right one. Most customers will be looking for a cryptocurrency wallet that is safe but also convenient. There is always going to be a tradeoff.

What is the Cryptocurrency Wallet Anyway?

The cryptocurrency wallet is a place to store your cryptocurrency. Modern wallets will give you the option to store a vast range of cryptocurrencies, including:

Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Ethereum (ETH) Dash (DASH) Monero (XMR) Ripple (XRP) Stellar (XLM) Litecoin (LTC) Dogecoin (DOGE) EOS (EOS)

A cryptocurrency wallet will often allow you to store a number of the above coins. You can get a private key for each individual cryptocurrency or a general passphrase to recover all of your funds, depending on the wallet type.

Getting a private key for each coin is safer as only one of them will ever realistically be at risk, but it can be a little tricker to store and manage them all.

The single most important thing to remember is that the passphrase is basically the identifier for your funds. Keep it safe, because if you lose it you can’t recover the funds. The passphrase and the private keys provide the same function, as the passphrase is used to generate the private key to restore your funds.

There is no real consensus about the best way to store your private key or passphrase, but making at least one physical copy and storing it in a secure location is recommended.

The following are the different cryptocurrency wallet options available. While each has distinct advantages and disadvantages, the online and web wallets tend to be the most popular. They allow for the best mix of security and convenience.

#1 - The Crypto Exchange

Many people will purchase their cryptocurrency from large exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken. This is very useful in terms of convenience, especially as there will likely be a lot of storage options for multiple cryptocurrencies.

Unfortunately, it's a terrible place to actually store your crypto. Crypto exchanges have a history of being hacked and it's not really under your control. Plus, the exchange could seize your funds if you don’t comply with certain KYC procedures.

In many ways, the crypto exchange defeats the purpose of cryptocurrency. You no longer control your funds, and you have to adhere to the typical KYC procedures to do business. You might as well be trading fiat currency.

In any case, the crypto exchange is too convenient for use and funds should never be kept here except in small amounts. You don’t get any private keys passphrase because your funds are not really ‘yours’ when they are on an exchange.

#2 - The Online Wallet

The online wallet is much more popular and still very convenient in comparison to the exchange. It’s where the majority of experienced cryptocurrency users store their crypto.

You are not really ‘storing’ your crypto with a third party provider because only you have access to the private keys. The online provider does not actually have access to your funds. This is a key distinction setting the cryptocurrency ecosystem apart from the legacy banking system.

Should anything happen to the online provider, you can easily restore your funds once you have these private keys which are not shared with anyone.

In other words, there is practically nothing to worry about. You can login to a multipurpose online wallet for a variety of different cryptocurrencies and easily send them anywhere.

With the online wallet, you are entering your username and password every time, which can be a security threat. However, most online wallets will have the option to enable Two Factor Authentication (2FA).

This means that even in the unlikely event of a criminal getting your login details, they won’t gain access due to the 2FA and trade pin/password.

#3 - The Desktop Wallet

The desktop wallet is a very safe way to store your cryptocurrency. With the desktop wallet you are storing your funds locally (on your computer). When you enter your login details this is not broadcast over the web. A hacker ‘listening’ could take these details to gain access to the wallet.

However, as mentioned above, 2FA and trade passwords mitigate this to a large extent, so that even if your login details are compromised, your funds are still safe. So the desktop wallet and the online wallet are about the same when it comes to security.

Be careful to download official desktop wallets. You are downloading an executable file to your computer which does pose a risk. It’s also worth noting that desktop wallets are still ‘somewhat’ connected to the internet, in terms of retrieving information, but now with quite the same level of exposure as online wallets, sometimes called hot wallets.

#4 - The Hardware Wallet

The hardware wallet is undoubtedly the safest way to store your cryptocurrency funds. Hardware or cold storage wallets are tied to a physical device. Online, you are exposed to billions of people. The web exposes you to the world.

But a criminal actually has to know your location, take your hardware wallet, and even then they will need you to voluntarily give them the keycode. And they don’t know how much funds you have. In other words, hardware wallets are as safe as it gets.

You should use a hardware wallet if you are storing hundreds of thousands of dollars of cryptocurrency. Until then, the online and desktop wallets with correct protocols are more appropriate. The hardware wallet does not allow you much convenience and you will probably want to store it somewhere.

Might not be the nicest feeling if you leave your expensive hardware wallet at the nearest Starbucks!

#5 - Niche Wallet Options

Did you know that you can store billions of dollars of cryptocurrency on a piece of paper? In the early days of cryptocurrency, paper wallets were used. These were simply printed pieces of paper with the private keys on them. You generated a wallet and disconnected the printer from the internet while printing the code (so there would be no record).

These were known as cold storage paper wallets. But it is the alpha-numerical characters on the paper that count. This is essentially the key that unlocks the ‘location’ of your funds on a given blockchain. Paper wallets are not really used anymore as standalone wallets. They are too impractical.

You could also just remember this code without printing or saving. This is only recommended if you have some kind of photographic memory! You could and most likely will forget them.

Mobile wallets are typically online wallets that have been adapted for mobile. They are generally quite safe, though smartphones do not have the typical security features in comparison to desktop devices and tend to be targets for hacking specialists.

Mobile wallets can be online and/or local to the phone. With the number of innovations in the crypto security industry, the lines can easily become blurred between the various wallet categories. Regardless of what option you choose, guard your private keys.

What is the best way to secure my cryptocurrency?

While many might complain about the level of hacks and scams, the reality is that the loss of crypto funds is most heavily due to basic user error and mindlessness. If you follow the basic precautions your funds simply are not going to go missing.

Blockchain wallets almost never get hacked. Phishing scams and ICO fraud operations are a little different, but reputable blockchain wallet providers are rock solid when you enable 2FA and trade passwords. A far bigger threat is the cryptocurrency scam industry, where ‘investors’ are enticed to deposit their funds to a specific address. The senders often never hear from the con artists again.

Think about it. What are the chances that a criminal is going to break into your home, then find a piece of paper with a random series of words written onto it, and then log on to your online cryptocurrency account to download all the funds before you are made aware? It’s preposterous, and has probably never happened. But the chances of you losing your passcode are far, far higher. This has happened tens of thousands of times, if not more.

You can also self-encrypt your paper wallet, perhaps by inserting the real word every second word or writing it backwards. You can store the mechanism/methodology of encryption in a different location in your home - ‘Real XMR Passcode Every Second Word’. Don’t keep the mechanism of encryption in the same place as the wallet passcode!

As secure as this is, it might not be necessary. Pick a good wallet, take precautions, and you’re safe. User error is a much greater concern than wallet security, and people are typically tricked into sending their coins to the wrong address as opposed to being hacked.

The bottom line

The bottom line is that online wallets are the way to go when it comes to cryptocurrency wallets, though desktop wallets can also do a decent job. Hardware wallets are not worth it unless you have significant amounts of crypto and they incur an initial investment of about $100.

For maximum security, you could also consider splitting your funds between hardware and online wallets. This is a very sensible option that will allow you security and convenience.

You can simply transfer from your hardware to the online wallet as needed to enjoy the best of both worlds."
6,"“How to ride the Metaverse trend: Top 3 Metaverse coins to invest in”

Since Mark Zuckerberg announced on October 28'th that Facebook would change its brand name to Meta, its stock price went up by more than 9%, which is more than Nasdaq in the same period. Moreover, at its Ignite conference, Microsoft unveiled that it was working on a corporate version of a Metaverse based on its Teams chat software.

As a result, the interest in metaverse-focused crypto projects soared. Many crypto enthusiasts believe that the crypto and Blockchain-based metaverse sector will become a multi-billion dollar industry. Honestly, this could be so if you take a look at the current expansion in the space. This expansion is directly proportional to the crypto and gaming industry (two multi-billion-dollar sectors) since most of the metaverse revolve around the two sectors.

Therefore before diving into the three top-tier metaverse projects, let's look at what is metaverse and what makes a project top-tier.

What is the Metaverse?

The term metaverse was first coined by author Neal Stephenson in his 1992 book ""Snow Crash."" Neal envisioned a 3D world where the user's avatars would meet, interact and engage in all sorts of activities like games and learning.

According to USA Today, the metaverse is simply a combination of multiple technology elements, that is – Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and videos where users reside within a digital universe. While metaverse technology may seem years away from being fully utilized, companies like Meta (previously Facebook) and Microsoft are integrating virtual experience technologies like Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality to enhance the virtual experience.

What is the difference between VR and AR?

Most people tend to confuse the two technologies; therefore, if you are a potential user or investor in the metaverse sector, it's crucial to understand their differences and how they are applied in different projects.

Augmented Reality (AR) – is an interactive 3D experience that overlays visual elements, sounds, and sensory stimuli onto the real world for enhanced customer experience. A good example is the Pokemon Go game App.

Virtual Reality (VR) – is an entirely 3D virtual world that enhances fictional realities so that users can interact with objects in a digital virtual environment. While AR can be accessed using a smartphone and users control their position in the real world, VR is accessed through special glasses, wristbands, and gloves, and it alters the appearance of the environment completely.

What makes a Metaverse project a good investment?

Since Metaverse cryptos are all the rage currently, any company with enough capital can launch a project and package it as the next big thing. However, like any technological revolution, only a few metaverse companies will be able to disrupt the internet potentially.

Here are a few factors to look out for when analyzing a project:

The team behind the project

When you decide to invest early in a crypto project's airdrop, the chances are that there is usually no working product or service. This means that you are betting on the team behind the project to deliver. If the team is strong, credible, and has an excellent social media status, they are more likely to develop a working product – even if their idea is not groundbreaking.

So, before investing, always do a background check on who is behind the project.

Project Roadmap

The roadmap is a crucial part of a metaverse project. Here you get to see what the project aims for, what it has done, and what it promises. Beware of new projects with an unclear roadmap and an anonymous team. Projects with a great roadmap are more liquid and easier to sell for profit because there is a promise of future value.

Market Value

The main factor that measures a project's size is the market value. Calculated by: Market Cap = Current supply * Circulation supply. Since metaverse crypto projects are relatively new, some are offering trillions in tokens to grow their value at low volumes rapidly. This quickly dilutes the tokens (shares) of the long-term investors. Therefore, always value metaverse projects by the value of its products rather than market value or market cap.

Project Features

There are various kinds of metaverse projects, from gaming, VR experience, corporate-focused, E-sports, video sharing to retail stores, to mention a few. Therefore as an investor, you need to understand the main features and what sets it apart from other projects in the same category.

Top 3 Metaverse coins you should invest in

Decentraland (MANA)

Decntraland, also known as the virtual social world, is one of the first crypto metaverse projects. It encapsulates almost anything you can think of in a metaverse as it mimics the physical world. Decentraland has been around since 2015, but it wasn't until 2017 that it became popular.

Like other metaverse projects, Decentraland allows players to experience and explore through avatars. Moreover, players can attend virtual events, play games, study at the Decentraland University, trade digital assets in the marketplace, or develop games. Every virtual asset on Decentraland is owned by the users and managed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

The platform operates on three native tokens: LAND, an ERC-20 token used to represent digital land and parcels; MANA, an ERC-20 token user to as the currency and ESTATE, an ERC-721 NFT token used to represent merged land parcels to form estates. To invest in Decentraland, you need to buy MANA, which you can hold or later exchange for land parcels or estates.

The land parcels on Decentraland are divided into a fixed total of 90,000 parcels. This is a crucial aspect of the platform because as the platform becomes more popular, there will be more demand for the land. Therefore, looking at the financial perspective of Decentraland, it is a good investment.

Where to buy:

Decentral Games (DG)

Decentral Games is the first community-owned NFT-related metaverse Casino. While there have been many other projects like this in the crypto space, Decentral Games is probably one of the few making significant developments to actually make gambling in the metaverse a reality. DG allows players to play poker, blackjack, roulette, and slots, to mention a few.

The platform operates on two tokens, $DG and ICE NFTs. $DG is used to promote community governance and as the medium of exchange between participants on the DG ecosystem. $DG token holders can propose and vote on governance to determine features and parameters of the games. The voting weight is directly proportional to the amount of $DG tokens staked. Moreover, $DG holders earn a percentage of the profit earned by Decentral Games.

ICE NFTs are avatar wearables that enable players to earn ICE by completing daily challenges and playing games. Players can view, buy or delegate their ICE NFT to other skilled players to play on their behalf. Players can also mine ICE which they can sell to other players who require it to mine rarer NFT wearables.

The aspect of play-to-earn is a unique model that makes DG unique. The model is similar to that of DeFi in the summer of 2020. Projects like Axie Infinity have also proven the model's effectiveness in bootstrapping a community around expected-value gameplay. Taking into account the number of gamblers worldwide, Decentral Games may be the next go-to place. With its low market value and supply (1 million $DG tokens), going mainstream will make it a great investment for early adopters.

StarLink (STARL)

StarLink's recent rise in popularity is just a clear representation of the power of Crypto and Blockchain developers in her community. StarLink was developed by Woof Decentra, a core player in projects such as SHIBA, LEASH, and also recently DOONT BUY.

With StarLink, Woof references what Elon Musk is doing with Starlink and the community around that sector. StarLink is the first community-owned decentralized metaverse space project. It allows users and players to explore space and different galaxies that resemble real-world galaxies. Moreover, players can buy and sell space ships and virtual land in Starl station the same way users purchase land on Decentraland or Sandbox.

StarLink operates on $STARL tokens and SATE NFTs. $STARL tokens are the utility tokens powered by Ethereum, while SATE NFTs represent transferrable digital assets such as satellites, virtual estates, avatar costumes, or starships. Additionally, users who hold $STAR tokens are allocated voting rights within DAO to ensure the platform is completely decentralized and autonomous.

While StarLink may have various competitors like the Star Atlas project developed on Solana, it's the first project to launch its beta version. Therefore, it has an advantage over the other projects, plus it's a popular project since it's attached to the developer of SHIBA. If its support is anything like SHIBA's support, it is set to increase its value over the years.

The Bottom line

In the past two years, most businesses have moved their operation to the digital space. This shift has also been rapid, forcing many companies like Microsoft and Facebook to come with solutions that help transform the corporate sector through Metaverse-based solutions. Therefore, it seems that Metaverse projects are here to say, and there are hundreds to millions of dollars to be earned by the early adopters or investors."
7,"Safemoon is an altcoin making waves around crypto-space. You can get Safemoon on your coin wallet easily. This piece will introduce safemoon, educate on how you can buy and keep it in your wallet, and finally why you should store it directly on your coin wallet.

What Is Safemoon?

Safemoon is a DeFi token on the Binance Smart Chain that rewards investors with huge rewards. The platform describes itself as a purely decentralized finance project where the community is at the center of its development.

Safemoon was launched this year and has already gotten the attention of the crypto world because of its reward schemes, sharp rise, and price retraction, etc. Safemoon launched in March, and as the name implies, it plans to take users or believers in the token to the moon safely.

While the name is meant to show trust, what has happened around the platform since its launch in March has left users and analysts wondering whether it's a safe ticket to the moon. The main reason for this is due to the fact that Safemoon doesn't have any real value of utility whether it is within the DeFi range like exchanges, NFT, gaming, etc.

The platform encourages users to hold for long-term benefits and penalizes users 10% for trading the asset with a sharing and burning formula that supports long-term investments.

This has been the basis for calling it a Ponzi scheme because it has that outward structure. In defense of Safemoon, they want to reward long-term holders, and they had a fair and decentralized launch. Safemoon has been in the eye of analysts because of the overwhelming number of influencers who advertise for the coin on Tiktok and other sites.

After its launch in March, Safemoon l on a massive price run over 2000% giving users insane value, which brought attention to the coin. Shortly after, the coin retracted by 60% amid fears of a potential Ponzi scheme.

The price of Safemoon is up again, but it is still far off from the $1 point. Safemoon has responded with its robust roadmap, which will see added utilities to the project, including its exchange, being listed on top exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, etc. Safemoon plans to push on with its reward agenda while adding the utilities to the platform.

How Can You Buy SafeMoon?

Safemoon is a new cryptocurrency that hasn't been listed on top exchanges partly because of the fear among crypto enthusiasts that the project might be a Ponzi scheme. However, as a project on the Binance Smart Chain, the asset can be gotten through Pancakeswap, a decentralized exchange on the Binance Smart Chain. Because of this, you can't pick it up through the easier method of purchasing it through a centralized exchange and transferring it to your wallet.

You can get Safemoon through different methods. First of all, you can get it through an online crypto wallet like a coin wallet that is compatible with the Binance Smart Chain. This is as a result of the fact that you'll have to link the wallet to Pancakeswap. You'll need to purchase BNB then swap your BNB with the Safemoon. This seems like the easiest method for many users to get the token, and Coin Wallet affords ease and security.

Another way to get Safemoon is through a hardware wallet. It's still the same steps with the software wallet, but the hardware wallet will need to be compatible with BEP 20 tokens.

Coin wallet, issued by CoinSpace, remains the most preferred method of getting and holding Safemoon because of the ease, convenience it provides to users. CoinSpace stands out among crypto exchanges for offering the lowest fees in the industry.

CoinSpace provides a user with a unified wallet address that can be used to manage all crypto, making it easier to hold Safemoon along with other assets in your portfolio. To store Safemoon in the CoinSpace wallet, you'll open a Safemoon wallet through the following steps.

The process is simple:

Select 'Create New Wallet'

You will be given a unique passphrase. This is your only way to access your Safemoon wallet account. This information cannot be retrieved if lost, so it is essential to record it in a secure place.

From here, you're ready to send and exchange tokens with the app. You can buy tokens with a credit card, Google Pay, Apple Pay, or your existing crypto assets.

One Wallet For All Your Needs

Coin Wallet offers the Safemoon wallet for Android, an Apple Safemoon wallet, and an online desktop/laptop version.

Use an Anonymous Safemoon wallet

Coin Wallet wallets keep your transactions completely secure and anonymous. We store zero personal data, meaning that your account is virtually impossible to compromise.

The most important thing to remember about using an anonymous Safemoon wallet is that no one can access your wallet except you — not even us. That means that your passphrase must be kept in a secure location because it cannot be retrieved from any database if lost.

Advantages of Using a Safemoon Wallet App

A Safemoon wallet is necessary to buy, sell, or store Safemoon tokens. They provide direct access to the blockchain and an interface to view, trade, or spend your Safemoon tokens.

All your Safemoon transactions happen through your wallet, which is why it's important to select a wallet provider that has strong security measures in place and can facilitate fast transactions

Why Store Safemoon with Coin Wallet?

Whether you plan to use your wallet for secure asset storage, for daily trading, or as a convenient way to make day-to-day purchases, Coin Wallet has the features you need:

Fast, Seamless Payment

Coin Wallet has integrated payments via credit card, Google Pay, and Apple Pay so that you can purchase Safemoon and other cryptocurrencies with the payment methods you already use.

A 4-Pronged Security Approach

Coin Wallet users can count on the security of their assets. We use bank-level security to prevent hacking and application-level authentication from protecting unauthorized logins. We ensure that only you know your password by not storing it in any database. And we keep your device fully localized by maintaining a server-free environment.

Total Privacy

Coin Wallet stores zero personal data to keep your transactions completely secure and anonymous. We also say no to third-party advertisers, which store personal data that can be used to track your crypto activity and link it to your other online and mobile usage.

Hardware-Grade Security

Coin Wallet allows you to secure your wallet using any FIDO-certified security key. Once set up, this security key will need to be connected to your device (or tapped if NFC compatible) to complete any sensitive actions, such as sending coins, changing security settings, or exporting private keys.

Why Is It Better To Send Safemoon Directly to Your Coin Wallet?

Normally, you can buy a cryptocurrency or token directly to an exchange or have it transferred to your wallet. Linking wallets to platforms is beneficial, especially during arbitrage, as it helps for easy conversion. For Safemoon, it is far more helpful to buy it directly in your wallet rather than buying it and transferring it from wallet to wallet.

This is due to the fact that anytime Safemoon is bought or transferred, it comes with a ten percent fee. Putting that into perspective, if you buy 100 safemoon tokens from Pancakeswap and you want to transfer it to your Coin Wallet, it comes with a 10% fee which means that you'll get 90 safemoon tokens.

This is mostly due to the platform's reward policy to give back payouts to long-term investors who are made to hold on to their tokens. A 10% transfer fee is an unnecessary expense in getting the token if you can just link it to your Coin Wallet. Though users are hopeful that the platform will reduce this fee with time, it hasn't, and it may remain this way till the end of the year. Apart from this, Coin Wallet also offers added security, making your tokens safe in cases of hacks on an exchange.

Conclusion

Safemoon is a new altcoin that plans to take you to the moon. Though it has come under fire recently, the coin is still up in the market, and plans are still in motion to list the tokens on more exchanges and improve its utility.

Safemoon has constantly not kept to its roadmap, but it is still going on slow and steady. So make sure you've ticked all the boxes before you commit to buy safemoon on Coin Wallet, and remember to buy it directly to the wallet."
8,"What is NFT?

An NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a digital asset that symbolises real-life objects, such as music, videos, art and in-game items. They are purchased and sold on the web, usually with cryptocurrency. They are also typically encoded with similar hidden programming or software as several cryptocurrencies. Even though NFTs have been around since 2014, they are becoming more popular nowadays because they have become a popular way of purchasing and selling digital paintings and sketches. NFTs are usually one-of-a-kind since they have special identifying codes.

How do NFTs work?

Every individual Non-Fungible Token is entirely different from each other and is not distinguishable. Non-Fungible Tokens gives the ability to the user to claim possession for a rare piece of digital information, traceable by utilising Ethereum's Blockchain as the public ledger. A Non-Fungible Token is created from digital items, representing non-digital and digital resources. An NFT can have only one owner. Possession is managed through the special identification number and metadata that no other token can duplicate. NFTs are made through smart agreements that relegate possession and deal with the transferability of Non-Fungible Tokens. When individuals creates a Non-Fungible Token, they execute a code stored in smart agreements that conform to various criteria, such as, ERC-721. This data gets added to the Blockchain where the NFT are being overseen. The creation procedure has the following stages that it goes through: minting a new block, verifying data and recording data into the Blockchain.

Benefits of NFTs trading

NFTs represents a wide variety of options, which might interest a large population of investors. By buying NFTs, one has the chance to expand or broaden their portfolio and to possess and collect rare items, which can be verified and exchanged. One of the significant benefits that NFTs offers is the possibility of collecting. Like purchasing antique pieces, the market for NFTs can give people a place where they can exchange and collect rare items that might increase in value after some time. The NFT market is possibly a high opportunity to collect and exchange digitally in a world that moves toward digitalising everything. Another benefit of exchanging inside a Blockchain is that every token has a special identification number, which is practically not possible to copy. These safety measures help to give additional assurance to financiers that the token they are purchasing is unique.

Current challenges of NFTs

One of the significant challenges confronting the NFT market is the absence of a centralised market place and a predefined Blockchain in which each Non-Fungible Token are managed. Presently, NFTs depend vigorously on the Blockchain Ethereum, which has its own local currency called “Ether”, which empowers smart agreement technology. Nonetheless, the developing interest in the NFT market has resulted in increasingly slow handling rates and more significant transaction costs because of the additional use. One more significant challenge identified with more competition is that for every Blockchain in the Non-Fungible Token market, the owner needs to maintain a single and specialised wallet. When bought, the investor holds the possession rights to the NFT which implies they can sell the NFT again whenever they want.

The problem that emerges is that if a singular holder invests money in a Non-Fungible Token that was made on the Ethereum Blockchain. Then, at that point, the NFT will need an Ethereum wallet. In case the same holder invests money creating an NFT using competitor Blockchain. For example, Near or Flow, the owner, will also need a wallet explicit to the Near or Flow Blockchain. This will create several layers that might confuse owners in the market. The possible risk is that as the market grows, the intricacy and level of expertise required to manage Non-Fungible Tokens and wallets also increase.

Future use of NFTs

NFTS will be used in the future for the following purposes:

Increasing the usage of paperless transactions – Storing information in regards to signatures and the person in an NFT helps to increase paperless transactions. Businesses are not interested in documenting every detail or information on paper since it is extremely time-consuming. They prefer to go digital. Moreover, NFTs can also be beneficial for people with their ‘paperless' benefit. People who require to provide papers for verification will need to carry and store these papers in digital formats.

Asset forgery safeguards - NFTs can demonstrate significant resources in managing information alteration and duplication. NFTs do not just follow the basic functionalities of Blockchain with strong encryption. They also work with promising safeguards against bothered data and unconfirmed payments despite what might be expected.

Future challenges of NFTs

Even though people find NFTs extremely interesting, they also have several prominent drawbacks. For instance, high consumption of energy and vendor tax. One of the imposing NFT challenges comes from the environmental effect of creating or inventing NFTs. For example, one of the most popular crypto art transactions lately is collecting a collection of short movies by a Canadian musician called Grimes. The musician produced short movies with his brother. Nonetheless, the NFT-based movies were able to accomplish a price sticker of approximately $8 million. Even though this is a promising implication for NFTs in the future, the event also exhibits a significant uncertainty about their environmental effect. A filmmaker called “Memo Akten” established a crypto carbon footprint calculator that artists can use. However, currently, it is not being used by musicians or artists.

According to this particular carbon footprint calculator, the amount of energy consumed that were involved in selling short videos created by Grimes was enormous. The amount of energy consumed was approximately the same as the amount of energy consumed by an average European Union citizen in 30 years. Vendor tax is also another obvious challenge or drawback of NFT, which can impacts its future growth. Customers and dealers in the NFT landscape may find the precarious charges as a subverting factor for becoming a part of the NFT revolution. For instance, Beeple is expected to incur charges in the amount of roughly $10 million. This came as disturbing news for several digital artists and numerous aspiring NFT dealers. The United States government considers both NFTs and stock sales the same. NFTs sales are viewed as a representation of investment gain, suggesting their reliance on capital gain charges.

NFTs are collectables and thus incur the burden of high tax rates of up to 26 per cent. The UK has imposed several steps for countering the NFT difficulties of vulnerability in tax. The HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) has issued a guide regarding the taxation of cryptocurrencies in March 2021. The guide focused on strategies or techniques for merging past guidance on crypto-resource taxation. It will help increase new Human Resource Management initiatives in taxing crypto-resource trade token exchanges including ventures and individual dealers. Nonetheless, it is significant to notice that such type of guide is essentially a manual for deciding duty on NFT trading. It does not have any legitimate weight in the opinion of the United Kingdom government and might not hold well in the future. Hence, it is crucial to set up strict and detailed taxation regulations due to the increasing presence of Non-Fungible Tokens.

Future use of NFTs in the real estate business

Real estate is the resource class that has the greatest amount of cash in it. There are numerous ways NFTs can be utilised in the property business. First of all, it can be utilised to make land possession transparent. For instance, a person can put the possession for land on a Blockchain and permit other individuals to see it. The purchasers and dealers of real estate will also be able to benefit from NFTs in the future since they will not need to pay a high transactional fee. One more way in which NFTs can be utilised is in the management of the real estate business. For example, digital agreements can be utilised to manage different tenancy problems, like collecting rent and returning deposits to the occupants toward the end of the tenancy period. NFTs can also be utilised to establish a new kind of crowdfunding that will assist financiers in getting a return on their investments in property projects. For example, constructing buildings and rental flats. NFTs plays a significant role in the property business. The Blockchain provides a chance to connect to individuals trying to sell or purchase land with one another without the need to go to a third party. This will help save time and decrease transaction cost significantly while still guaranteeing or ensuring trust."
9,"Bitcoin is rapidly rising and investors analyze the continual potential rise in the crypto asset amidst whatever the world economy is facing, either it is inflation or deflation.

A highlight stating how Bitcoin has already gone beyond the $50,000 target thrice this year. Inflation concerns led Bitcoin and other Crypto. Because of the rise in Bitcoin, many companies and investors would be returning to the Bitcoin world.

Bitcoin is gradually taking the place of gold in the world of inflation. This is evident in the market rise in investors buying crypto and forsaking gold. This is because analysis has explained how bitcoin is the best to hedge against inflation than gold.

An investment banking firm stated how bitcoin is gradually becoming a good hedge against inflation than gold itself. Over the years, investors of Bitcoin have analyzed how Bitcoin would grow to become the new store of value over other assets, because of its continuous potential increase in price. And since it provides quick returns and increases more, promising a better valuation. who wouldn't want to own a bitcoin, even though it's not always a positive trend, but still has the potential to increase.

As said earlier, how bitcoin has gone beyond its target, which portrays the increase in the number of investors buying more Bitcoin, even if it might fluctuate in some period. But experts have analyzed that purchase of bitcoin might pay off in the long term.

It's been figured that most institutional investors are abandoning gold, and going back to Bitcoin since it's a better hedge than gold. For experts who have made various analyses, this comes as no surprise, as bitcoin showed a promising gain for investors. Following the performance of Bitcoin this year, it's no surprise that it always stands to give gain to its owners and withstand inflation.

Hedging Against Inflation

The professional analysis would describe how inflation is arguably healthy for a certain economy and positive for growing an economy. But it will be preferable to not hold on to cash during inflation, or even put your savings in the bank as cash, because it tends to lose its purchasing power, thereby reducing the value of your cash.

To hedge against inflation, it's best to turn your savings or income into the store of values like investing in stocks and most importantly cryptocurrency like bitcoin. Many market participants do this with their cash, to avoid a reduction in the value of their net worth. Other assets you can also invest in are precious metals, bonds, shares, and other related assets.

For an asset to be a better hedge against inflation, it must first be a good store of value, which means, it must be able to maintain its purchasing power over time, without any decline in value, remaining stable or increasing in its valuation amidst inflation saga.

Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation is known as a hard asset, because of its ability to increase and hold its value over time. There are certain vital properties that a hard asset must possess, there are;

Durable - the asset must continue to have demand for it over time. It must not lose its value.

Scarce- a hard asset must be scarce, limited in supply that allows for an increase in demand, thereby pushing up prices.

Accessible - the general market and its participants must be able to accept the asset as a store of value.

Bitcoin As An Hedge Against Inflation

Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation is an investment, also known as an asset that increases or maintains its value over time, shielding itself against the negative fluctuations in price. This is quite beneficial to investors, who use bitcoin as a store of value because inflation thereby won't be of any effect on its value.

Inflation is defined as the fall in the purchasing power of a currency over a period, which means that, what is purchased for a unit of currency today, the same unit of currency can't purchase the same stock, because of an increase in the price of the stock.

Inflation is mainly viewed as a measure of prices rising for both goods and services in an economy. This is evident in numerous country's economy, whereby inflation has shifted the value of the country's currency. In some cases inflation has crippled the economies of countries, not being able to recover from the persistent rise in prices.

Inflation is beginning to increase and professionals say the price rises are just starting, and there is to be a more persistent rise. Before now, Gold and other precious metals were considered to be the best way to hedge against inflation, but recently cryptocurrency like Bitcoin has become the store of value best to hedge against high inflation.

Although some school of thought doesn't accept Bitcoin as a store of value to be the best fit to hedge against inflation. Because of its reduction rate when its price tends to fall. Some week, cryptocurrencies might fall more than 36%, declining their value. So this school of thoughts claims, Bitcoin is not a store of value, but an evaporating value. Though, this might be right to some extent. Bitcoin has shown signs of long-term benefits.

Conclusion

Different Investors deal in cryptocurrency for various reasons. Some set of investors seek immediate profit while others seek to grow their fortune in a fast way. But there are certain people who it as a store of value and agree that bitcoin is better to hedge against inflation than gold and another asset. When inflation occurs, and currencies decline in value, these investors purchase assets such as bitcoin, to preserve their purchasing power and wealth. This technique is done to ensure the safety of their net worth amidst inflation in the economy, instead of the inflation reducing their savings drastically.

The growth Bitcoin has accumulated over the years has made experts see it as a good hedge against inflation. So instead of people purchasing gold and other precious metals, they are rather buying Bitcoin to preserve their wealth."
10,"Bitcoin is used as loan collateral for various reasons which are advantageous to the users. Some of the reasons for initiating Bitcoin as a collateral for loan are: arbitrage plays, operation costs are covered without holdings being sold, making of the market, leveraging up (buying more crypto).

Crypto loan segments have grown large over the periods, aiding hodl investors to get cash without selling their crypto assets. The evolution of assets from physical to digital has enabled this innovation appealing, because of the unsophisticated process to get loans. Paperwork is eradicated and getting loan is now made fast and easy. The loan application is available to all who can satisfy the requirements of the loan. There is no involvement of the bank, and since it's digital, it is open to individuals around the world, making lending break the barriers of international borders.

Bitcoin has been at the forefront of the crypto world, thereby making it validated as a store of value. Apart from the crypto loan platform, some financial institutions now accept Bitcoin as collateral for personal loans to individuals. Bitcoin is being used as collateral for a loan, because of its present worth and its futuristic worth. Its valuation gave room for other promising cryptocurrencies, aiding their increase and improving the crypto market.

There are various reasons why many investors known as hodl investors would want to collect a loan using their major crypto-asset (Bitcoin) as collateral.

Bitcoin as Collateral for Loan

Some banks like the swiss banks have started to offer bank loans by making use of Bitcoin as collateral. Although this has not been accepted by the general financial institutions, lenders in this segment of loans are now making more feasible options. Competition emerging within these banks makes interest rates lower than normal and provides a vast option for loans, which innovates the lending world aiding businesses.

The negative reaction that Bitcoin had in time past has now been eradicated, as people have realized the advantage it has, and how it has become the virtual currency in the world. Bitcoin has now been seen by many as an asset like any other asset, because of its valuation.

Because of the risk attached to using bitcoin as collateral for loans, interest rates are quite high and the period for the loans collected using bitcoin as collateral are relatively short. Bitcoin has proven to be more acceptable as collateral than other crypto assets because of its value, and investors won't want to sell out their bitcoin even if there's a temporary need for cash.

Hodl investors are mostly the benefactors of these Bitcoin collateralized loans, as it aids them in their holding on to crypto-assets to gain an increase in the asset price. These investors have analyzed the benefit of collecting loans using bitcoin as collateral than actually selling it out for cash gain, the experience of not virtualizing the long-run gain of bitcoin has made the investors learn from past mistakes.

Reasons For Using Bitcoin as Collateral for Loans

Covering Operation Cost

Miners have the most to benefit from bitcoin being used as collateral for loans. Miners are professional investors and deal in a capital-intensive business. So there is a need to cover the cost of operations, which is then done through loans, to avoid selling Bitcoin that was freshly minted.

Deferment of Tax

Investors may want to avoid paying tax, which would have been triggered if the Bitcoin was sold out, instead borrows cash to defer tax and also satisfy his need for cash at that moment without selling his Bitcoin asset.

Arbitrage

This is a widely used case for borrowing. The crypto market still has the futuristic advantage of profit increase, so traders then lock up their bitcoin as collateral to borrow cash. The arbitrage concept is a strategy whereby the trader spot price with shorts on future contract, and therefore hold on to the asset till expiration. Most investors take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity.

Leveraging up

Most experts use this strategy to boost their exposure in the crypto market, where they lock their bitcoin as collateral to borrow cash, and then use it to get more Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Although derivative exchange offers the same increase in exposure of cryptocurrency, leveraging in trading through loan collection gives a whole distinct process to liquidation. The collateral collection structure is quite distinct from that of the derivative exchanges. In leveraging, businesses don't have the aim of liquidating their borrowers' crypto, but in the derivative market, liquidation fees even exist, this gives the reason for the boost in popularity of leveraged lending.

Platforms That Accepts Bitcoin Collateralized Loans

Even though many financial institutions are not willing to accept bitcoin as collateral to give loans, because of its risk nature. Banks always seem to operate in a safe loan space to avoid losses that could have been prevented. While major institutions drive away from receiving Bitcoin as collateral, few companies have taken advantage of this innovation and solved a major problem for hodl investors. Here are some of the companies that Bitcoin collateralized loans.

YouHolder

This platform uses Bitcoin as collateral for loans and they give as high as $30,000 and low as $100 to any users who meets its requirement. Apart from bitcoin, the YouHolder also receives six crypto assets as collateral, which aids users in storing up crypto assets rather than liquidating. A huge problem has been solved by this, as it helps investors get cash without liquidating their Bitcoin. The loan period is short, last for about 120days

Salt Lending

The gain in receiving bitcoin as collateral is huge, and Salt lending sees this potential profit and occupied the loan space, taking risks that companies aren't willing to take with a bitcoin collateralized loan. Although interest rates are higher than the traditional loan institute.

EthLend This platform also acts as other platforms do with a special approach called peer-to-peer, offering cash for Bitcoin without actually selling the bitcoin. And it acts more like a marketplace to both its borrowers and"
11,"Cryptocurrency evolving beyond the regular innovation of the finance world has yet again created a new segment where lending and borrowing of investment for cash has been made possible. This is one benefit that now comes with investing in crypto, being able to use your cryptocurrencies as collateral for loan collection. This is beneficial because no matter how small your crypto investments are, they can serve as collateral depending on the loan amount you want. These cryptocurrency loans are very much accessible offering to the hodl investors an easy way to gain liquidity from their crypto investments without selling any of the cryptocurrencies.

Crypto Loan Platform

A cryptocurrency loan is a segment of the crypto that involves the lending of cryptocurrency and interest is earned. These are meant for traders that wish to collect cash without actually selling out their cryptocurrency investments, therefore using it as collateral for liquid funds, in expectation of a future increase of their crypto asset. This segment of crypto is hosted by platforms that receive deposits of various kinds of crypto investments, ranging from the stable coin, etherum, bitcoin, and other valuable currencies, and in return with interest. The parties involved in these transactions are; the borrower, who needs liquid funds and thereby takes loans through the lending platform for some interest in exchange. And the lender, that has crypto and wants to gain additional income with it.

Categories Of Crypto Loans

The categories of crypto loans are just two, which are:

1. Custodial crypto (CeFi) loans

These loans are custodial, whereby an entity known to be central takes possession of the collateral. In this category, the trader cannot have any access to the asset he gave as collateral, the lender posses ownership of the asset for that period. The custodial crypto loans are very obtainable and inexpensive and the regular loans, but the lender enforces the terms. Most crypto loan platforms are custodial, cause it reduces the risk for lenders.

2. Non-custodial (DeFi) crypto loans

The Non-Custodial crypto loans otherwise known as Decentralised finance loans, unlike a custodial crypto loan, there is no dependant on centralized lenders to execute terms of the loans, rather they are dependant on smart contracts. In this DeFi crypto loan, the trader still has control of their assets' private keys until there is a default in the loan payment. But no direct cash can be given through this DeFi crypto loan, rather stable coins are given to be turned into cash. The interest rate for DeFi crypto loans is much higher than the CeFi loans.

Best Platforms For Crypto Loans

This is listed according to its categories.

13,"Millennials are different from other generations in many ways. The disparity between these generations can be seen in daily choices, even down to investment. From boomers to gen Z, each generation takes its path motivated by the social factors and technological breakthroughs in its youth.

The mass adoption of the world wide web led to a shift from analogue investment to the digital era. Boomers successfully made the switch to the stock market following a rise in investment banking and hedge funds.

However, technology, especially FinTech, isn't static, and the evolution seems to have left the leading generation in investment trailing behind. For example, blockchain technology which was flagged off in 2009, changed the dynamism of finance as it opened the gateway for DeFi, decentralized finance. DeFi, an umbrella term for financial transactions without a central body like banks, government, etc., has led to a new phase in financial investments.

Cryptocurrencies and DeFi tokens (digital assets) are receiving worldwide adoption, but the demographic behind the adoption shows that millennials are doing much better than the rest of the pack. The concept of cryptocurrencies is more prevalent among young people as it's a new way of investing and has been dubbed 'the digital gold'.

Current Crypto Demographic

The crypto demographic is entirely predictable as a result of several reasons. Boomers, Generation X, Millennials, and Gen Zs have all contributed to the mass adoption of digital assets in one way or another. A recent survey shows that the current ownership of cryptocurrencies is championed by Millennials and Gen Zs. 76.4% of cryptocurrencies are controlled by Millennials, while 17.40% are in the hands of Gen Zs.

The remaining 6.1% are held by Gen X, and boomers holding 4.93% and 1.22%, respectively. This data clearly shows that age and birth play a huge role in determining if one would purchase cryptocurrencies. This demographic is the same across many countries.

A survey by top crypto exchange Gemini shows that 20 million Americans are preparing to jump on the crypto train. In addition, 67% of millennials in the survey said they would like to learn more about crypto because it's a new asset class and is likely to invest soon. In crypto day trading, millennials lead in this area as some have taken it as their full-time or part-time job through yield farming mechanisms.

Why Are Millennials Buying More Coins?

Social factors and technological advancements can lead to decisions made by a whole generation. Cryptocurrencies and other digital assets are best understood by millennials, who make the bulk of the workforce at the moment. The shift from the traditional mode of finance to the blockchain resonates with millennials as they tend to look for more accessible investment alternatives.

Young people find cryptos attractive because they are easier to use and an investment that doesn't require much work with their capital still in their wallet and can be liquidated anytime without hassle.

Over time, it has been proven that people tend to dump the old way of doing things for the newer model, which tends to be more productive. The shift from traditional investment models to the blockchain by millennials and Gen Zs shows that young people are sticking with ""the future of money"".

Millennials are on top of the crypto trend because of the speed of finance and investment in the present era. As bills and standard of living continue to climb, young people are thinking outside the box to meet up with their expenses. Though cryptocurrencies are risky investments, young people are willing to take the risk because of the wide range of options it brings. DeFi tokens are growing daily, NFTs are undergoing booming growth, play-to-earn platforms are expanding their reach, adding up to the possible options for millennials.

The financial incentives from arbitrage and crypto day trading also encouraged millennials to go into cryptocurrencies. Millennials around the world have quit their old jobs to join the crypto community as yield farmers, day traders, and arbitrageurs. Making pips on the difference between assets in multiple exchanges is a very lucrative way for millennials to earn and lead the financial world.

The adoption of blockchain technology also represents a shift from the old money to the new money, and millennials want to control the assets rather than leave them to a third party or the government. The fair and transparent impact blockchain has on finance is another reason for the growing adoption from millennials.

Though Gen Zs are younger than millennials and should be more on cryptocurrencies, they don't have the economic power to compete with millennials. On the other hand, millennials are the current workforce, so they are the perfect blend of exposure to technology and finance to back their interests.

If Gen Zs have more access to funding like millennials, they will top them on the charts. In addition, the rapid advancement of blockchain and dapps solutions in solving issues in the workplace is another factor that millennials have an advantage of.

The rise of cryptocurrencies this year can be likened to the support it received from Elon Musk. The billionaire has always tweeted about his love for blockchain, bitcoin, and dogecoin. The meme tweets by Elon Musk speak to millennials as they grew with the meme culture. Dogecoin, which started as a joke, soon got the interest of everyone. Millennials rallied around the coin and other meme coins more than any other generation.

The Rest of The Pack

Millennials hold more cryptocurrencies than people in other generations. Though millennials naturally have the advantage because of technology and other social factors, different generations also contribute their share. There are even debates in some quarters regarding how long millennials can remain in control. Let's start with the boomers. Boomers are the oldest generations we'll consider. Born between 1946- 1964, boomers are not the technological favourites to jump on cryptocurrencies.

The general issue around boomers and digital assets are on risk and exposure. Boomers lead the pack in terms of a diversified stock portfolio and other traditional asset classes, so their investment drive isn't in question. However, cryptocurrencies are highly volatile assets compared to stocks. Furthermore, they are not regulated by multiple governments threatening to ban or put severe checks.

Boomers and Gen Xs prefer stability in their choice of investments. In addition to this, the growth of cryptocurrencies has suffered more blows in boomers' hands as they sit on top of most government organizations. They have been vocal about the threat cryptocurrencies pose to the world and their role in encouraging crimes on the dark web. This dark era for boomers and Gen Xs seem to be changing gradually though a lot still needs to be done. The mass adoption of digital tokens has seen increasing numbers of boomers and Gen Xs jump into cryptocurrencies.

This can be influenced by the fact that governments and the United Nations have backed blockchain technology. Different countries have even rolled out or issued templates for their Central Bank Digital Currencies which sends a message that the future of money is digital. In addition, countries like El Salvador backing Bitcoin and huge technological giants will play a role in the future adoption of digital assets.

However, this year has seen increasing adoption of digital assets as the crypto market capitalization surpassed $2 trillion. Institutional investors who were sceptical about investing in cryptos started joining gradually, with the big banks each adding cryptocurrencies as a new asset class to their wealthy clients. As Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, etc backs cryptocurrencies, other financial institutions follow suit, giving older investors more confidence to invest in cryptocurrencies.

Gen Zs are the closest rivals to Millenials in cryptocurrency investments. Technology is on the part of Gen Zs to take digital investments to the next level. The growth of social media has increased idea sharing and has helped build communities around digital assets. While other generations struggle to keep up to the far-reaching lengths of DeFi, Gen Zs prefer digital investments to traditional forms of money. They see themselves as the ones who will make the change.

The boom in NFTs and the metaverse shows that the future of holding assets and making money is evolving rapidly, much to the delight of Gen Zs. Gen Zs now prefer digital collectibles because they can easily be traded to physical collectibles. The only limitation for Gen Zs is funding. If they had the money the other generations have, they'd be sitting right at the top.

What Does The Future Hold?

The future of digital assets looks good as more people worldwide will continue to try their hands around coins in the coming years. Though millennials lead the pack, Gen Zs will rule in the future. The growing technology behind DeFi is on the part of Gen Zs, and when they gradually have access to more funds, they will get more digital assets. In addition, Gen Zs see cryptocurrencies as an easier form of investment and are likely to invest more in them than in traditional investments."
14,"The current trend of the vast increase in cryptocurrencies and digital wallets has made banks and other related financial institutions adapt to this trend. It's an alarming necessity for banks to let investors trade valuable assets using a more secured and transparent platform in various parts of the world. The potential benefit that blockchain technology has to offer can no longer be talked down, the banking industry has now adapted and adopted the use of blockchain technology into their banking activities. The effect and importance the blockchain technology has around the global commerce ecosystem are enormous, it has shifted global commerce into another era.

Blockchain technology runs on an open-sourced software that enables investors to gain simultaneous access to the public ledger updated and no single opportunity to alter transactions. Just as blockchain technology has made a great impact on the world economy, it has created a new era for the banking industry, from the usual methods of securities to more Hi-tech securities. Most alteration in transactions takes place because third-party intervention leaves flaws or windows for it to be possible, but Blockchain technology increases efficiency and security without the intervention of any third party.

Let's now dive into the ways by which banks and other financial institutions make use of blockchain technology.

Ways By Which Banks And Other Financial Institutions Uses Blockchain Technology

It has become a frequent occurrence to hear news of banks are currently looking for how to make use of blockchain technology to transform and adapt to the new norm. Banks at first criticize the use of the blockchain technology that led to the creation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. But with the vast increase in the importance of the technology, banks could no longer watch as the banking industry suffer the aftermath of not adapting and adopting the technology.

So these are the areas blockchain technology can be effective and efficient for the banking sector:

1. ** Incorporating Clearing and Settlement into BlockChain**

This is one of the biggest areas of the banking sector, the tangled web which takes records of loans and securities and to run it cost billions of dollars. Hence the need for blockchain technology, a statistic showed that banks could save a whopping sum of 10 billion dollars using blockchain technology to boost the efficiency of the clearing and settlement sector of the banking industry.

Blockchain technology can restructure this sector, having a major impact on the clearinghouse. One of the best examples of a financial institution that's restructuring is the Australian Securities Exchange. The ASE aims to move most of its post-trade clearing and settlement into blockchain technology.

2. Payment Systems

In the various countries of the world, most central banks are seeking the potential shift of some of their payment system into blockchain technology, while other central banks are exploring options to creating their digital currencies. This is in response to the threat that Bitcoin poses to the monetary policy under their control, the inability to subject the cryptocurrencies to their control. This shows that central banks have finally seen the possible benefits of incorporating their payment system into the blockchain technology

Most banks are already pushing onto their project and not waiting on the central banks. They are already incorporating blockchain technology into their payment system. Although with the complexity involved in shifting to another era of the payment system, it might take several years before central banks can be able to issue their digital currencies.

3. Trade finance Into Blockchain

Trade finance is a bulky part of the banking sector, that bankers even plead for a modernized way out, because it is mostly on paper, examples like, letter of credit, bill of lading, which are sent via fax or post. It is believed that blockchain is a modernized way out as there is a vast number of people that need to access the same information. Blockchain is a solution and can provide a vast number of elements in the area of trade finance.

The nature of trade finance made it impossible to modernize, since it's of old ways, and even requires a physical stamp on paper and transferred through the fax machine. This gives blockchain the avenue to be efficient. As much as digitalization of trade finance is important, so is digitalizing trade itself. This means shipping companies are involved in this digitalization process, also the freight providers and the agents, the insurers, and others. So banks can't work alone to achieve this aim but work with all the arms of trade to effectively make an impact.

Customer's Identity

Identity is a core component because it's very vital to incorporating blockchain technology. Confirmation of clients and counterparties is very essential for the banking sector. With this feature, lenders wouldn't rapidly forfeit their roles as trusted managers of people's money. Regulators hold banks accountable for checking that clients are not criminals, thieves or impostors and make sure they pay fines when a wrong deed has been done.

Banks have failed on several occasions to come up with the formula to record customers' identities and update them regularly. But with blockchain technology possess cryptographic protection and also can share a regularly updated record with various parties. This helps tackle money laundering and enables knowing your client, which regularly, the cost to run these systems are way huge and if a mistake is made, the cost is much more.

5. Syndicated loan Market in Blockchain

The period it takes a company to raise money through syndicate loans on average takes about 19 days for the banks to settle the transactions. A fax machine is mostly used for communicating, when loans are being given out, or being paid early, which is backtracking the sector. Syndicate loans are being incorporated into the blockchain system, has it proven to be the perfect system for guarding the lifecycle of loans.

Blockchain technology would not only correct the inefficiency of syndicate loans on its own, just like trade finance. The business process must change to be able to incorporate blockchain technology into the syndicated loan market."
15,"Oracle solutions are not new to crypto as they perform the critical function of linking smart contracts with the required information it needs to execute. This piece aims to educate on the leading oracle solution, Chainlink and its role in blockchain and the cryptoverse. An introduction to the origin of smart contracts and oracle solutions is necessary before delving into Chainlink, its native token, how it operates and its utility to blockchains.

Understanding Chainlink

Blockchain technology has led to a boom in DeFi solutions as every day leads to a new step towards achieving perfect decentralized finance. The bitcoin whitepaper and subsequent blockchain indeed opened the eyes of many and catalyzed Ethereum and other blockchains and projects. As we already know, centralized finance is characterized by intermediaries, private and government controlling, monitoring and managing financial services.

This push away from this system came from the possible manipulation of financial systems by intermediaries and the bureaucracy involved in the management of users. Though centralized finance gave the world uniformity and global economic prosperity, clamour soon arose to do away with intermediaries leading to the end of market manipulation. Thus, although Bitcoin was the first blockchain, it was the Ethereum blockchain that led to the creation of dApps, decentralized applications powered by smart contracts.

A smart contract is a set of programs on the blockchain which becomes executed if certain conditions are met. Apart from blockchains being a decentralized public ledger to record transactions that cannot be manipulated easily, smart contracts are the real juice that makes blockchain leap to the world of DeFi. Therefore, it is not surprising to see new blockchains, including smart contract feature to host dApps.

Since DeFi pushes the notion of a world where financial transactions occur without monitoring centralized bodies, smart contracts are a perfect replacement. Smart contracts may be used by crypto exchanges, blockchain gaming, NFT marketplaces etc. Smart contracts are automatic; therefore, their functionality will depend on the information they receive to execute correctly. If a smart contract receives wrong information or data, it will execute in favour of the wrong party, and that defeats the whole purpose of DeFi.

Imagine a smart contract to execute when the price of BTC gets to $55,000, but before it gets to the mark it executes, it will cause problems for a party. Smart contracts which have bought full DeFi functionality cannot stand alone but need information on-chain or off-chain from oracle solutions.

Information on the blockchain would not be sufficient to cater to the ever-growing and complex smart contracts being rolled out daily. As a result of this, most of the information needed for a smart contract to function is obtained from external sources.

Chainlink and Its Utility

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle solution that allows smart contracts on the blockchain to interact with external data it needs to execute successfully securely. Founded in 2017, it was the goal of Chainlink to become the engine of smart contracts by providing all the critical information like prices, world events that can't be gotten from the blockchain (off-chain data) to smart contracts.

Chainlink as an oracle solution perfectly integrates with multiple blockchains and feeds them the required data without jeopardizing one for another. However, the problem with most oracle solutions is the fear that they can be manipulated while providing the smart contract wrong information.

A breakdown of this problem is that if a smart contract needs a weather report to execute and the oracle gathers the wrong weather report for the particular day, the smart contract will be executed in error.

To mitigate this problem, oracle solutions have come up with methods. However,v Chainlink is far ahead of others that have earned the trust of blockchain developers. In addition to being an oracle, Chainlink is an oracle aggregator making it challenging to come up with incorrect information.

Chainlink gathers information from several other Oracle providers and uses its internal mechanism to check for similar repetitive answers and dissenting answers. Then, Chainlink pays these oracle providers and strikes the ones with a wrong answer, going as far as seizing their tokens.

Chainlink has gained the trust of many partners over the years, including AAVE, Synthetix, Arbol, etc. Chainlink currently offers market data, sports data, weather data and makes the process easy by smart contract developers simply applying a ""Get Request""—the result of Chainlink points to its perfect interoperability between on-chain and off-chain applications.

The utility of Chainlink stretches to the tamper-proof input and output data feeds and its perfect organization, making it possible for developers to get a grasp of the whole process quickly.

LINK

Link is the native utility token of the Chainlink network. Link is an ERC 20 token that is used to compensate node operators for their services. For example, blockchain operators need Link to seek information for their smart contracts from Chainlink.

The Link tokens go to the Chainlink node operators for their services. Chainlink prides itself in being a decentralized oracle solution and aggregator, so Link makes the network functional.

The amount of Link paid by a smart contract developer to a node operator is set by the node operator depending on what it costs the node operators to get the off-chain data. As a result, the amount of Link paid isn't fixed but fluctuates depending on the data. While this is a good model for node operators and the community behind Link, the burden is borne by smart contract developers.

Link can be gotten from CoinSpace and crypto exchanges. As an ERC 20 token, it can be stored on almost every wallet that supports Ethereum tokens. Link is ranked 14th in CoinMarketCap with a market capitalization of $12,401,066,558. There will be a maximum of 1,000,000,000 Link tokens with a current supply of 419,009,556 tokens.

How Chainlink Works

Providing smart contracts with off-chain information is not as complex as it may seem. Chainlink has made the process easy, with steps broken down to guide the developer and node operator. The process kicks off when a smart contract requires information ""Requesting Contract"" for information. Once the ""Requesting Contract"" is made,

Chainlink registers it by creating another smart contract called an SLA contract ( Service Level Agreement Contract). This new smart contract further generates three (3) sub contacts that carry out the entire process. The subcontracts are; The Chainlink Reputation Contract, The Chainlink Order-Matching Contract, and the Chainlink Aggregating Contract.

The Chainlink Reputation Contract:

The authenticity of the information judges an oracle solution it provides to the smart contract to function correctly. The Chainlink Reputation Contract looks at the track record of the oracle provider. It has a negative history of incorrect answers; it will not be accepted as only reliable nodes are accepted.

The Chainlink Order-Matching Contract:

At this stage, the ""Requesting Contract"" is matched with the most suitable node operators. Next, Chainlink takes the node operators' bid and puts it to account, then selects the number of nodes required to work on the request.

The Chainlink Aggregating Contract:

This contract receives all the data from node operators and filters it to know the right and wrong answers. Thus, this contract can validate data from both single and multiple sources.

From multiple sources, most times, the average principle is used. If four nodes deliver a particular answer and one node delivers another answer, the four nodes were right, and the one node with a different answer is wrong. Chainlink rewards node operators for this process with Link and punishes faulty nodes by withholding their tokens.

Chainlink's Achievements in Crypto.

The creation of Chainlink has been for the overall interest of blockchains. Blockchains need off-chain information gotten from oracle providers to function. Since the creation of Chainlink, it has received a growing adoption in the market, with different blockchain firms like Aave, Synthetix, Arbol, etc., adopting it. Chainlink now receives information from many reliable sources such as Google, CoinMarketCap, Brave New Coin, etc.

Chainlink currently partners with Google to provide weather information to smart contracts on blockchains. The effects of bad weather have led to the loss of money. Smart contracts can help predict the weather and the feasibility of an investment considering weather reports. Chainlink currently partners with Google Cloud to provide the required data to the smart contract.

In addition to this is the live market feed that Chainlink receives from CoinMarketCap and Brave New Coin. Chainlink is building a ""billion-dollar"" bridge to connect hundreds of blockchains while providing them with the necessary data.

Conclusion

Chainlink is at the forefront of oracle solutions in the market due to its efficiency and reliability. As long as decentralized finance keeps breaking into new areas, oracle solutions will keep growing to feed more data to smart contracts. So far, the growth of Chainlink has been commendable as Sergey Nazarov and his team have been rolling out new developments to keep it way ahead of the competition."
